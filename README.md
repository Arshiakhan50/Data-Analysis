# Data-Analysis
I conducted a comprehensive data collection process involving more than a hundred students to determine their perspectives on the ethical implications of ChatGPT in academia. Subsequently, I meticulously analyzed the acquired data, employing advanced statistical techniques to explore the intricate interplay between gender, age, occupation, and the diverse range of responses provided.

To facilitate this analysis, I used the NumPy library, which provided a robust foundation for numerical computations and data manipulation. I organized and processed the collected data, enabling efficient exploration of various trends and patterns within the dataset.

Furthermore, I utilized the CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format to seamlessly manage the structured data. This facilitated data storage and allowed for a systematic approach to data handling, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the subsequent analysis.

For the purpose of visually representing the relationships uncovered through the data analysis, I employed the Matplotlib library. Matplotlib served as a powerful visualization tool, enabling me to create insightful graphs and charts that illustrated the correlations between gender, age, occupation, and the nuanced responses regarding the ethical considerations surrounding ChatGPT's implementation in academia.
